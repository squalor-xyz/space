Create an expert-level hyper-realistic WebGL simulation of Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy. 
Focus on creating a scientifically plausible yet visually stunning representation that captures the awe-inspiring nature of our galaxy's central black hole.

features:
---

- the blackhole should be fixed, and fully visible.
- the photon ring should be swirling realistically.
- the simulation should loop and play continuously
- Doppler boosting effects (where material moving toward us appears brighter)
- Multiple photon rings with increasing sharpness
- Jets of particles being ejected from the poles
- Lens flare effects for dramatic lighting
- Interactive controls to adjust parameters in real-time


quality and output:
---
- as high resolution as is possible to render, running on modern web browsers (especially firefox).
- output is an html file, which may contain javascript, as long as the html file is all that is needed for the simulation to render and run.
