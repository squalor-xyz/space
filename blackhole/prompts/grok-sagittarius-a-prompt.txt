Create an expert-level hyper-realistic WebGL simulation of Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy. 



the blackhole should be fixed, and fully visible.

the photon ring should be swirling realistically.

the simulation should loop and play continuously



as high resolution as is possible to render, running on modern web browsers (especially firefox).

output is an html file, which may contain javascript, as long as the html file is all that is needed for the simulation to render and run.
