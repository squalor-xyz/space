Create a hyper-realistic WebGL simulation of Sagittarius A*, the supermassive black hole at the center of our Milky Way galaxy. The simulation should feature:

BLACK HOLE PHYSICS:
- Single fixed black hole at screen center with realistic parameters:
  * Schwarzschild radius (rs): ~0.015
  * Spin parameter: ~0.7  
  * Lensing strength: ~0.3
- Accurate gravitational lensing that distorts background stars
- Dynamic accretion disk with:
  * Realistic rotation and turbulence using 3-octave FBM noise
  * Temperature gradient from hot inner regions to cooler outer regions
  * Time-based glow variation and subtle flickering
- Event horizon as a perfect black circle
- Frame dragging effects from black hole spin

VISUAL ELEMENTS:
- Background: Tileable high-resolution star field (use NASA star map)
- Color scheme: Golden accretion disk with orange-red inner glow
- Continuous 300-second animation loop controlled by progress slider
- Smooth 60 FPS performance using requestAnimationFrame
- 4K resolution rendering via off-screen framebuffer

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Pure WebGL1 with self-contained HTML/JavaScript
- High-precision float calculations
- Linear texture filtering
- Proper blending (SRC_ALPHA, ONE_MINUS_SRC_ALPHA)
- Optimized for mid-range GPUs (limit shader complexity)
- Cross-origin image loading with graceful error handling

Focus on creating a scientifically plausible yet visually stunning representation that captures the awe-inspiring nature of our galaxy's central black hole.
