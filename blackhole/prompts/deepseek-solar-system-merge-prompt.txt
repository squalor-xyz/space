Create a serene 4K WebGL visualization of solar system dynamics during galaxy merger, focusing on stellar motions rather than black hole physics. The simulation should feature:

STELLAR POPULATIONS:
- Two galaxy systems represented by procedural point clouds:
  * ~50 twinkling white stars per galaxy (100 total)
  * Hash-based positional offsets (~0.2 range)
  * Subtle wobble using sin(time + star_index)
  * Orbital motion around respective galaxy centers

SOLAR SYSTEM HIGHLIGHTS:
- Yellow point (size ~0.005) representing our solar system:
  * Orbits Milky Way center at radius ~0.1
  * Orbital period synchronized with 300s loop
- Cyan point for Andromeda solar system:
  * Similar orbital characteristics
  * Disappears after galaxy merger (progress > 0.8)

GALAXY DYNAMICS:
- Galaxy centers follow identical spiral merger path as black hole simulation
- Smooth orbital decay over 300-second loop
- Clear visual distinction between background stars and solar systems
- Subtle star trails and twinkling effects for realism

VISUAL AESTHETIC:
- Background: High-resolution star field (clamped, non-repeating)
- Color scheme: White stars, yellow/cyan solar system markers
- Serene, minimalist appearance emphasizing cosmic scale
- Continuous 300s animation with progress slider
- Reduced resolution (1080p) for optimal performance

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
- WebGL1 point rendering with custom shaders
- Hash-based procedural star positions
- Time-based uniform updates for animation
- Optimized for smooth performance (50-star iterations)
- Cross-origin background image loading
- Self-contained HTML with proper blending

Focus on creating a peaceful, educational visualization that illustrates how solar systems move within merging galaxies, providing scale and context for cosmic evolution.
