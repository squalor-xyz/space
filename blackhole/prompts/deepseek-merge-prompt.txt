Generate a hyper-realistic 4K WebGL simulation of two supermassive black holes merging - representing the future collision between Milky Way and Andromeda galaxies. The simulation must include:

GALACTIC MERGER DYNAMICS:
- Two black holes with realistic mass ratio (Milky Way: ~4e6 Msun, Andromeda: ~1e8 Msun)
- Initial wide separation with spiral inspiral over 300-second loop
- Merger trigger at progress > 0.8 with:
  * Position averaging into single black hole
  * Schwarzschild radius scaling by sqrt(combined mass ratio)
  * 5-second bright flare during merger
- Dual gravitational lensing that sums deflections pre-merger
- Tidal interaction effects between accretion disks during close approach

BLACK HOLE CHARACTERISTICS:
- Milky Way BH: rs ~0.02, spin ~0.7, golden accretion disk
- Andromeda BH: rs ~0.02*sqrt(mass_ratio), spin ~0.9, blueish accretion disk  
- Independent disks/rings until merger, then unified system
- Realistic lensing distortion of background galaxy image

VISUAL COMPLEXITY:
- Background: Tileable merged galaxy image (Hubble visualization)
- Color progression: Golden + blue disks â†’ red/orange merger flare
- Smooth orbital decay with spiral turns
- Continuous 300s animation with progress slider control
- Optimized shaders maintaining 60 FPS at 4K resolution

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATION:
- Self-contained WebGL1 implementation
- High-precision floating point
- Linear texture filtering for background
- Proper alpha blending for overlay effects
- Cross-origin image loading with fallbacks
- Mid-range GPU optimization (limited FBM octaves)
